# Half Bridge setup

Status: not tested
Picturs follow.

This example is the easiest way to get into it: Just take a normal DC motor.
Connect one pin to 'V' and the other pin to ground.
The pin assignment between your Arduino Uno and the BLDC shield is as follows:


Inhabit pins:
INHU = 6
INHV = 5
INHW = 3

Input pins
INU = 11
INV = 10
INW = 9
