# Half Bridge setup

Picturs follow.

This example shows, how you can turn a motor in both directions.
Just take a normal DC motor. Connect one pin to 'U' and the other pin to 'V'.
The pin assignment between your Arduino Uno and the BLDC shield is as follows:

Inhabit pins:
INHU = 6
INHV = 5
INHW = 3

Input pins
INU = 11
INV = 10
INW = 9

Plug in your supply voltage for the board (e.g. 12V) and run the code!
