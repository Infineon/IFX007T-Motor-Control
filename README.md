# IFX007T-Motor-Control
IFX007T NovalithIC™ based DC motor control 

The (Brushless) DC motor control shield from Infineon technologies is a high current (up to 55 Amps) motor control board compatible with Arduino and Infineon’s XMC series. It is equipped with three smart IFX007T half-bridges. The BLDC motor control shield is capable to drive one BLDC motor. Alternatively, it can be used to drive one or two bi-directional DC motors (H-Bridge configuration, cascaded to support second motor) or up to three uni-directional DC motors (half-bridge configuration).The implemented integrated IFX007T NovalithIC™ half-bridges can be controlled by a PWM via the IN Pin. Interfacing to a microcontroller is made easy by the integrated driver IC which features logic level inputs, diagnosis with current sense, slew rate adjustment, and dead time generation. The three IFX007T half-bridges are also fully protected against over-temperature, under-voltage, overcurrent and short circuit events.
